UN/LOCODE assigns codes to locations used in trade and transport with functions such as seaports, rail and road terminals, airports, post offices and border crossing points. The first issue in 1981 contained codes for 8,000 locations. The version from 2008 contained codes for about 60,000 locations. NOTE 2:     UN/LOCODEs have five characters. The first two characters are letters: the country code as per the table defined in ISO 3166-1 alpha.  Three remaining characters encode a location within that country. Letters are preferred, but if necessary digits 2 through 9 may be used (This avoids confusion between "O" and "0", and between "I" and "1".).</xsd:documentation>

The only exception is the descripton of code 9  which CCIPdescribes as 'own propulsion' and WPFITP as 'Mode Unknown'. To align both descriptions, we propose to rename the lable of code 9  to 'Mode Unknown/Own Propulsion' Code    Mode of Transport             Explanations 0       -                    In principle, this code should not be used since the digit '0' may be employed                               to indicate absence of entry, etc. If this is not the case, the code can be used when                               indication of a mode of transport would be irrelevant, e.g. statistical reporting                               should not take place (for samples, gifts, personal effect, etc.). 1       Maritime transport             Provision is made for separate reporting of inland water transport under code                               8, assuming that appropriate definitions and rules of application will be given,                               particularly when transport covers sea as well as inland waterways. 2       Rail transport                - 3       Road transport             - 4       Air transport                - 5       Mail               (Active mode of transport unknown) - This code is provided for practical                               reasons, despite the fact that mail is not a genuine mode of transport. In many                               countries, the value of merchandise exported and imported by mail is considerable,                               but the exporter or importer concerned would be unable to state by which                               mode postal items had passed the national border. 6       Multimodal transport          (Active mode of transport unknown) – This code is provided for practical                               reasons, despite the fact that multimodal transport is not a genuine mode of                               transport. It can be used when goods are carried by at least two different modes                               from a place at which the goods are taken in charge by a transport operator to                               a place designated for delivery, on the basis of one transport contract. (Operations                               of pick-up and delivery of goods carried out in the performance of a                               unimodal transport, as defined in such a contract, shall not be considered as                               multimodal transport.) 7       Fixed transport             This code applies to installations for continuous transport such as pipelines,                               installations ropeways and electric power lines. 8       Inland water transport          This code is used only in such cases where the application of waterborne                               transport is reported separately within the framework of a one-digit code. 9       Mode unknown/             This code can be used when the mode is not known or when information on it       Own Propulsion               is not available at the time of issuing the document concerned.

    <xsd:annotation>
      <xsd:documentation>Objects that represent a type of customs warehouse NOTE: the following customs warehouse type are distinguished: Type A: a public warehouse where anybody can store their goods and where the warehouse keeper is responsible for fulfilling the obligations arising from the placing of goods under the Customs Warehouse procedure. Type B: A public warehouse where anybody can store their goods and where the depositor is responsible for fulfilling the obligations arising from the placing of goods under the Customs Warehouse procedure. Type B warehouses are often used by stevedores, agents and transport companies in ports to store goods for a limited time until the means of transport has arrived to further distribute the goods to the place of destination. Type C: A private warehouse where only the warehouse keeper can store goods, where the warehouse keeper is the same person as the depositor but is not necessarily the owner of the goods. Type D: A private warehouse where only the warehouse keeper can store his goods, where the warehouse keeper is the same person as the depositor but is not necessarily the owner of the goods. In contrast with the other warehouse types the Import Duties are calculated based on the rules of assessment ascertained or accepted at the time when the goods are placed under the Customs Warehousing system. This type of warehouse is quite similar to a type C warehouse Type E: A private warehouse where only the warehouse keeper can store his goods, where the warehouse keeper is the same person as the depositor but is not necessarily the owner of the goods. For this type of warehouse it is permitted to place the goods under the Warehouse Procedure without them being physically stored in a Customs Warehouse. This type of warehousing requires a high level administrative organisation including inventory records, as the physical location of the goods is not the key factor, but the fact that the goods are entered in the warehouse records. Customs must be able to follow the goods through the records system. This type of warehouse is the most sophisticated type which gives maximum flexibility to the warehouse keeper, but also requires a high level records system. Type F: A public warehouse where anybody can store their goods, which is operated by the Customs authorities. This type of warehouse is very rare. </xsd:documentation>

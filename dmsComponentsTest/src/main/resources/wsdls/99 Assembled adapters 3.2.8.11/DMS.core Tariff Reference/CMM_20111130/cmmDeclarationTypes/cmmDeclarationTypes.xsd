EXAMPLES:		if the amendmentReason = 2 (estimate) and the last pointer refers to the attribute 'netMass' of GoodsItem met 'itemNumber[3] 					under ConsignmentShipment sequenceNumber[5], then this means that the contents of the involved attribute is an 								estimate 
				if the amendmentReason = 7 (deleted) and the last (and also first) pointer refers to the Declaration then this means that the that 				the whole declaration is deleted

If during verification of coverage, the coverage mode switches from 'postponed' to 'cash' (e.g. when a guarantee for (a part of) the coverage mode is missing and it is configured that the whole customs debt must then be covered by cash), DMS must reset the value of the attribute.</xsd:documentation>

      <xsd:documentation>Object capturing a Duty/Tax/Fee data of a particular duty type as calculated by DMS

WCO ID:			DutyTaxFee
WCO Desc:		Calculation of one instance one duty, one tax, one fee
WCO Comment: 	Each instance of this class is to be used for a single occurence of a duty, tax or fee 

NOTE: Explanation:
A GoodsItem may involve zero, one or more distinct DutyTaxFee objects each representing a component amount of a distinct tax type (Dutch: belastingmiddel). A DutyTaxFee object consists (among other attributes) of the following fields:



type: 			Object representing the type of tax 
base:			(Dutch: maatstaf): object of type 'Measure' representing the number of units on which the calculation of this tax part is 	based. At runtime, 'base' may 					dynamically adopt the form of one of the 'Measure' sub types 'MonetaryAmount' (an amount specified in a particular Currency), a 'Measurement' (a 				value in a particular MeasureUnitType) or 'Quantity' (a discrete value in a MeasureUnitType 'PCE' ). So a base always specifies a value and the unit type 				in which it is expressed

rate:       (DU: Tarief): the applicable proportion or unit charge. The rate attribute is of also of type 'Measure' which, again, may adopt the form of one of its sub            types 'MonetaryAmount' (if the base is a Quantity or 'Percentage' (if the base is a Monetary Amount)

givenAmount:  a derived value calculated by multiplying the measure base


 by the rate (taking the rate's unit type into account)

Two examples may demonstrate this setup. 

Suppose a tax is based on the declared goods item value of 20.000 Euro and a tariff of 2.5% applies. 
In this case the DutyTaxFee object will contain the following fields:
base:       a MonetaryAmount object with fields: value=20.000 and unitType[type='EUR'].symbol=€

rate:         a Percentage object with fields: value=2.5, unitType[code='P1'].symbol=%

Relief is either determined:

-	by customs automatically (using the Tariff tax calculator based on relief codes)
-	by customs manually in case no relief code exists but manual duty calculation applies or when a relief code applies but the customs official decided to override a relief amount calculated automatically; in that case the manually entered amount has priority (like any adjustment, this manual entry will yield a new version, with the 'isManuallyAdjusted' atttribute set to 'True' and a non-void adjustmentReason attribute)
-	outside DMS on an authorization for particular combinations of procedures (i.e. 40 00 101) and commodity codes. In that case there will not be a relief code or relieved amount (but the declaration must include the authorization of the applicable type)
-	 by the declarant, provided in the declaration (in case of the import part of outward processing with partial relief); if this is the case, no automatic calculation based on a relief code shall apply NOT YET SUPPORTED:

    <xsd:annotation>
      <xsd:documentation>The customs value of a declaration goods item as derived by DMS from data in the declaration and passed to the Tariff Management Calculation Service to be the base for determining the goods item's customs debt.
NOTE 1: 	The declaration customs value is derived applying the following rule: 

1: Use the declaredCustomsValue if the customs value is explicitly provided in the declaration (as the 'declaredCustomsValue attribute in GoodsItem)
2: Use the value of the BOM GoodsItem.Valuationadjustment of type '40' corresponding to the answer to DV1 question 24 - if DV1 data is provided with the declaration -
3: Else, use the sum of the values of the BOM GoodsItem.Valuationadjustment of types '??' ....corresponding to the answer to DV1 question ?? - if DV1 data is provided with the declaration 
4: Else, if the declaration includes a monetary amount in the field corresponding to SAD box 47 (tax base) take the customs value to be:
-	the value related to tax type A00 (Customs duties on industrial products) or	
-	the value related to tax type A10 (Customs duties on agricultural products) 
5: Else, use the value provided in the field corresponding to box 46 (statistical value, being a good approximation) if included in the declaration

If duty calculation is applicable to the declaration and customs value can not be derived from data provided in the declaration, the Tariff Management Calculation Service will return a validation result ‘missing customs value’ which will lead to the declaration being rejected 

NOTE 2: 	Another way of arriving at the customs value (not supported by DMS) is by reducing the amount provided in box 42 (invoice amount) by the amount provided in box 45 (adjustment)
